          <h3>Readings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>When I was reading about the reccursive functions I was thinking how would I use it to get fibonacci numbers, then I read about the generic functions and thought that this might be less memory consuming. I liked how they implemented that function in the book.</li>
            <li>
              The idea of pure Functions is kind of weird for me, I guess because you have to break it to more functions and I'm not really great at it.

          <h3>Questions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              What are the best examples of using IIFE functions?
            </li>
            <li>Why would we need to define and rewrite a function inside itself?</li>
            <li>Aren't reccursive functions consume a lot of memory?</li>
            <li>Is there another way of achieving the same result without using reccursive functions? For example loops.</li>
            <li>Will JavaScript throw an error if we do not pass one argument?</li>
          </ul>
