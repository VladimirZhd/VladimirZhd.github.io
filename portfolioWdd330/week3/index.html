            Something That I learned and really excited about the objects is that we can do nested objects, also I never 
            used object's methods. It looks like a powerful tool to use. I'm excited about learning and using it in my projects.

          <h3>Questions</h3>
          <p>
            I have no question this week. Thanks for explaining the Array.prototype.reduce() more to us, it is makes sense now. I even used it to answear one of the questions on my interview.
