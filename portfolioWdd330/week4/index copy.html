          <h3>Readings</h3>
          <p>
            I need to think about the way how I can make more meaningful notes. I usually do reading everyday, but I do it when I go to bed, so it is hard for me take notes. I will try to choose a different time for the readings. I really enjoy it but I am really bad at taking notes. 
            
            Something that stood out to me about the forms that you can access form and it's cobtrollers in different way. I usually was using getById function, when I could just do form.controller 

            Another thing that was explained well is propagation on the event listener. I used the stopPropagation() method before, but i didn't know how bubbling was working. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Questions</h3>
          <p>
            When do we need to use bubbling and when capturing?
            
            Can we spend some time to go through RegExp?
          </p>
